# Rookies Codingers - Login Form Project

Welcome to the **Rookies Codingers** repository! We are a team of enthusiastic developers dedicated to crafting innovative and user-friendly solutions. Our current project is a sleek and functional login form designed with modern web technologies.

## Project Overview

We are developing a stylish and interactive login form using:
- **HTML5** for the structure
- **CSS3** for the design and animations
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and validation

Our goal is to create a login form that is not only visually appealing but also provides a smooth user experience.

## Branches

This repository follows a structured branching model to streamline development and collaboration:

- **`main`**: The stable branch where the production-ready code resides.
- **`frontend`**: Focused on developing and refining the user interface and user experience of the login form.
- **`backend`**: Handles any server-side functionality or integration (if applicable) related to the login process.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the login form looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- **Animated Transitions**: Adds a touch of modernity with smooth animations for an engaging user experience.
- **Validation**: Includes robust client-side validation to ensure users input the correct information.
